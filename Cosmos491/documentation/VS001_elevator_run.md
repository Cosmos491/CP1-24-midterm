# Experiment: Elevator Run (Linear Acceleration)

## Meta Information

**Unique ID**: VS001  
**Experiment Name**: Elevator Run (Linear Acceleration without Gravity)  

**Date and Time**: 5:16 PM  
**Current Weather Conditions**: Hot with really low humidity  
**Additional Information**: The experiment was conducted in a UB North Campus building in the elevator of Law Library. The elevator was moving from the lowest floor( 1st) to the highest(7th). The data collected represents linear acceleration in the x, y, and z axes during the elevator ride.

## Experiment Data

| Axis          | Acceleration (m/sÂ²) |
